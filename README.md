# VPipeline (Beta)

VPipeline is a library that was primarily designed for real-time synchronization 
via a global Redis cache. In addition to this framework, it offers
platform-dependent library code that can relieve some of the work for e.g. Spigot plugins.

This project is currently under heavy development. When there is a first stable version I will let you guys know.

### Note: This Page is under heavy construction at the moment.
I am also working on a wiki right now! 
The api will get big changes so use it at your own risk!
